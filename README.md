## About
[**Codewith Zden IDE**](https://ide.codewithzden.com) is a free and open-source online code editor that allows you to write and execute code from a rich set of languages. It's perfect for anybody who just wants to quickly write and run some code without opening a full-featured IDE on their computer. Moreover, it is also useful for teaching and learning or just trying out a new language.

Codewith Zden IDE uses [**Judge0**](https://ce.judge0.com) for executing the user's source code.

Visit https://ide.codewithzden.com, and enjoy happy coding. :)
